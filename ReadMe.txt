This builds on the excellent foundation provided by Rahul’s original machine learning implementation, which demonstrated how to predict bike availability for a specific station using time-series data. 
His approach clearly showcased how predictive modeling could be applied to real-world data from Dublin Bikes to forecast trends in availability throughout the day.
To complement and extend Rahul’s system, I have encahnced the application to allow for dynamic, station-specific interaction directly on the map. 
Rather than being limited to a hardcoded station and time, the updated version now responds to user interaction.
When a user clicks on any station marker, the app automatically fetches and displays prediction data for that specific station in a time series chart embedded in the info window. 
This feature brings Rahul’s model into an interactive web environment, enabling real-time exploration of predictions across the entire network of bike stations.
In addition, a sidebar visualization has been added to provide a **city-wide summary** of bike availability patterns. 
By processing historical data across a 12-hour window, the system calculates the average number of bikes available per hour across all stations. 
This data is visualized in a bar chart using Google Charts, giving users an at-a-glance view of typical bike availability trends throughout the day in Dublin.

These additions aim to highlight and support the predictive work already developed by Rahul, while making it more accessible and visually insightful for users through a fully interactive interface.
